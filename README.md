# SDC and TCL Files in Physical Design of a Chip
- I always do feel difficult that writing a TCL script to automate Synthesis step in the Physical Design flow. So, in this repository I'll be discussing the main TCL commands which used to automate the Synthesis stage in tools like Candence Genus. 
- Genus is a RTL Synthesis which comes with Cadence Tool Suite and it is used to generate netlist of the design after functional verification. 
# TCL Script: 
- A TCL (Tool Command Language) file in VLSI is a script file that contains a series of commands used to automate the design flow of electronic circuits. TCL is a scripting language that is commonly used in the field of electronic design automation (EDA) for creating and running scripts that perform various tasks in the design process.
- TCL files are typically created using a text editor, and they can be executed within an EDA tool or from a command line. By using Tcl files to automate the design flow, designers can save time and reduce the risk of errors that can occur when performing repetitive tasks manually.
- I have attatched the a basic tcl script. 
# SDC Script: 
- SDC (Synopsys Design Constraints) file is a text file that contains timing and physical constraints for a digital design. It is a widely used industry standard format for specifying constraints for electronic designs in VLSI.
- Overall, the SDC file is an important part of the VLSI design flow, as it provides a standardized way of specifying timing and physical constraints that is used by different EDA tools to ensure that the design meets its performance and physical requirements.
- I have also included a SDC file in this repository.
